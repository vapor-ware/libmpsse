/*
Package libmpsse is an open source library for SPI/I2C control via FTDI chips.
This package is a wrapper around the C libmpsse library. This repository
is a fork of the original libmpsse library, which can be found at:
https://github.com/devttys0/libmpsse

For this package to work, libmpsse needs to be installed, which itself requires
libftdi-dev to be installed. Installation instructions for libmpsse can be
found in the docs/INSTALL file.
